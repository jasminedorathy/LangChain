## ChatBuddy: AI-Powered Assistant with LLAMA3 & LangChain

An interactive chatbot driven by AI, ChatBuddy is made to intelligently and instantly respond to user inquiries. This project, which was constructed utilizing *LangChain, **LLAMA3, and **Streamlit, combines sophisticated language models with an intuitive online interface. The foundation of ChatBuddy's operation is **LangChain's ChatPromptTemplate, which organizes user inquiries and prepares answers to guarantee high precision and pertinence. With the help of **Ollama*, the LLM (long language model) supplier, the chatbot can produce insightful and contextually relevant responses to a range of queries.


Using *dotenv, the project is set up with a secure API management system that guarantees the safe handling of private data, including the LangChain API key. ChatBuddy's **Streamlit-based UI* makes it easier for users to communicate with the AI assistant and ask questions.
